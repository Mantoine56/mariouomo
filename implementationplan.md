   - In the admin panel, fetch shipping labels from aggregator.  
   - Store tracking number, label URL in a `shipments` table.

4. **Notifications**  
   - Optional: Email or SMS updates to customers regarding shipment status.  
   - Could use aggregator’s webhooks or a separate job to update statuses.

**Outcome**: A full fulfillment pipeline so store managers can handle shipping in one place.

---

1. **LLM Integration**  
   - Connect NestJS to a Large Language Model (OpenAI or similar).  
   - Decide how data is queried (e.g., natural-language to structured queries or direct LLM embeddings).

2. **Admin-Only Access**  
   - Strictly enforce that only admin roles can ask the AI to retrieve data.  
   - Possibly sanitize queries or add guardrails to prevent data leakage.

3. **Admin Dashboard UI**  
   - Simple chat interface for questions like “How many orders last week?”  
   - Display summarized or tabular answers.

4. **Testing & Validation**  
   - Ensure the AI’s answers are accurate and do not expose data from unauthorized tables.  
   - Refine prompts to keep responses business-appropriate.

**Outcome**: A novel, time-saving feature for managers and owners to quickly get insights from the store’s data.

### Final Notes

- Each chunk can be pursued **sequentially** or with some overlap (e.g., you can develop the Next.js front-end while still refining some back-end endpoints).
- Keep an eye on **RLS policies** to ensure data privacy and adopt best practices for **API security**.
- Phase in advanced features (AI assistant, multi-warehouse inventory, advanced reporting) **after** the basic e-commerce flow is solid.

By following this **chunked plan**, you’ll gradually build and refine each layer of the system, from database and back-end services to front-end customer experiences and admin management—all while minimizing conflicts and rework.
