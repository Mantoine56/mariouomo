### Final Notes

- Each chunk can be pursued **sequentially** or with some overlap (e.g., you can develop the Next.js front-end while still refining some back-end endpoints).
- Keep an eye on **RLS policies** to ensure data privacy and adopt best practices for **API security**.
- Phase in advanced features (AI assistant, multi-warehouse inventory, advanced reporting) **after** the basic e-commerce flow is solid.

By following this **chunked plan**, you’ll gradually build and refine each layer of the system, from database and back-end services to front-end customer experiences and admin management—all while minimizing conflicts and rework.
