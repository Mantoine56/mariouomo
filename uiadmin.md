# Mario Uomo Admin Dashboard UI Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive plan for implementing the Mario Uomo e-commerce admin dashboard, designed to replace Shopify's admin interface while maintaining professional-grade functionality and user experience.

## Technology Stack Analysis

### Framework Selection: Next.js + shadcn/ui

After analyzing various options, we recommend using shadcn/ui over alternatives for the following reasons:

1. **Advantages of shadcn/ui**:
   - Built on Radix UI primitives ensuring accessibility
   - Highly customizable components with Tailwind CSS
   - Type-safe with TypeScript
   - Modern, clean design that matches our brand
   - Active community and regular updates
   - Zero runtime overhead (copy-paste components)
   - Excellent documentation and examples

2. **Why Not Other Options**:
   - Modernize-Nextjs-Free: Less customizable, potential maintenance issues
   - Commercial templates: Often bloated, harder to maintain
   - Pure Tailwind: Would require building components from scratch
   - Material UI: Too opinionated, harder to match our brand
