# Implementation Plan for Missing Endpoints

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for the missing endpoints in the Mario Uomo e-commerce platform. The plan focuses on ensuring database schema alignment with entity definitions and proper controller functionality.

## Categories Endpoint Implementation

### Step 1: Database Migration (Completed)
- Created migration script for categories table
- Included closure table for hierarchical structure
- Added product_categories junction table
- Created appropriate indexes for performance

### Step 2: Entity Verification (Completed)
- ✅ Verified Category entity matches database schema
- ✅ Updated column names to match snake_case database convention
- ✅ Validated TypeORM decorators for tree structure
- ✅ Fixed Product entity to properly relate to Category entity

### Step 3: Service Implementation
- Verify CategoryService implementation
- Ensure proper error handling
- Implement tree structure management methods
- Add transaction support for data integrity

### Step 4: Controller Testing
- Test all CategoryController endpoints
- Verify authentication and authorization
- Test hierarchical operations (move, reorder)
- Validate response formats

## Variants Endpoint Implementation

### Step 1: Database Verification (Completed)
- ✅ Verified product_variants table structure
- ✅ Updated ProductVariant entity to match database schema
- ✅ Verified relationships with Product entity
- ✅ Validated option_values JSONB structure

### Step 2: Service Verification (Completed)
- ✅ Updated VariantService implementation
- ✅ Fixed inventory integration
- ✅ Enhanced error handling
- ✅ Updated validation for option values

### Step 3: Controller Testing
- Test all VariantController endpoints
- Verify authentication and authorization
- Test inventory-related operations
- Validate response formats

## Orders Endpoint Implementation

### Step 1: Database Verification
- Verify orders and order_items tables
- Ensure alignment with Order and OrderItem entities
- Check relationships with User and Product entities
- Validate address and metadata JSONB structures

### Step 2: Service Verification
- Review OrderService implementation
- Ensure proper inventory integration
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Implement order status management

### Step 3: Controller Testing
- Test all OrderController endpoints
- Verify authentication and authorization
- Test order creation and status updates
- Validate response formats

## Products Endpoint Implementation

### Step 1: Database Verification
- Verify products table structure
- Ensure alignment with Product entity
- Check relationships with Category and Variant entities
- Validate metadata JSONB structure

### Step 2: Service Verification
- Review ProductService implementation
- Ensure proper category and variant integration
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Implement search and filtering capabilities

### Step 3: Controller Testing
- Test all ProductController endpoints
- Verify authentication and authorization
- Test product creation and updates
- Validate response formats

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Testing**: Test each component in isolation
2. **Integration Testing**: Test interactions between components
3. **API Testing**: Test HTTP endpoints with realistic requests
4. **Error Handling**: Verify proper error responses
5. **Performance Testing**: Ensure acceptable response times

## Rollout Strategy

1. Deploy database migrations first
2. Deploy backend code changes
3. Enable endpoints one by one with monitoring
4. Gradually increase traffic to new endpoints
5. Monitor for errors and performance issues
