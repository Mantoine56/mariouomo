# Coding Pattern Preferences

- Always prefer simple solutions
- Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality.
- Write code that considers different environments: dev, test, and prod.
- Only make necessary changes that are requested or well understood and related to the requested change.
- Fixing bugs: Do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation. If a new approach is used, ensure the old implementation is removed to avoid duplicate logic.
- Maintain a clean and organized codebase.
- Avoid writing scripts in files if possible, especially if the script is likely only to be run once.
- Keep files under 200-300 lines of code. Refactor if they exceed this limit.
- Mock data is only needed for tests; never mock data for dev or prod environments.
- Do not add stubbing or fake data to code that affects dev or prod environments.
- Never overwrite the .env file without first asking and confirming.
