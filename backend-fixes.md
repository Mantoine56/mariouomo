4. [x] Execute migration scripts and verify schema changes with test queries

### Phase 2: Fix Database Query Issues
1. [x] Update repository pattern implementation
2. [x] Fix entity type definitions
3. [ ] Update repository queries to include proper selection conditions
4. [ ] Fix analytics service queries
5. [ ] Improve error handling for database operations

### Phase 3: Fix Missing Routes

2. [x] Fix module imports and exports
3. [x] Verify route registration
4. [x] Update test scripts to match actual API routes

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
1. [x] Retest all endpoints after fixes
2. [x] Fix TypeScript compilation errors
3. [x] Ensure all tests pass
4. [ ] Validate authentication works with real database
5. [ ] Verify role-based access control with database-stored roles
6. [ ] Document any remaining issues

### Phase 5: Integration with Frontend
1. [ ] Ensure API responses match frontend expectations
2. [ ] Implement proper error handling for frontend consumption
3. [ ] Add comprehensive API documentation for frontend developers
4. [ ] Test API endpoints with actual frontend requests

### Phase 6: Performance Optimization
